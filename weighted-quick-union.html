  // 'numbersArray' initializes the array of trees to be united. Each index of the array is the root of a tree; the value in each root initially points to its own root (i.e. numbersArray[0] === 0, numbersArray[1] === 1, etc)
  var numbersArray = []; 
  
  // 'treeSize' initializes the array that will keep track of each tree size. All trees start off with one element, so their size is one. Once two trees are united, the parent tree's size will increase by the size of the child tree and the child tree's will keep its size. Assuming no union was performed and we invoke uonion(0, 1) where threeSize[0] === 1, threeSize[1] === 1, we will arbitrarily assign one of the trees as parent and the other as child, because their size is the same (in our code below we assign the first root as parent and the second as child but it could be the other way around). After the roots are united, threeSize[0] === 2, and threeSize[1] === 1). 
  // so we have 0 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 where 1 became a child of 0
  //            |
  //            1
  // Suppose we now perform union(2,3) and then union(2,4), Resulting in threeSize[2] === 3, threeSize[3] === 1, and threeSize[4] === 1. We proceed with union(0,2) (or union(2,0), which will result the same): because threeSize[2] > threeSize[0], threeSize[0] will become a child of threeSize[2]. After running these operations the result will be threeSize[0] === 2, threeSize[1] === 1, threeSize[2] === 5, threeSize[3] === 1, and threeSize[4] === 1
  // so 2 5 6 7 8 9, where two is parent of 0, 3, and 4, and grandparent of 1, and 3 is the parent of 1
